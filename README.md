## Introduction

This Python script simplifies the process of downloading and uploading files to an FTP server. It can be a helpful tool for automating file transfers between your local machine and an FTP server.

## Dependencies

To run this implementation, you need:

- Python 3.x
- The `ftplib` module (usually included in Python standard library)
- A running FTP Client (You can create one for free on [Bplaced](https://www.bplaced.net/))

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elcruzo/ftp-client.git
   cd ftp-client
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check by running:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

   If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory containing the `index.py` file.

2. Open the `index.py` file in your preferred text editor or IDE.

3. You will find blocks of code under the while loop. Comment out the ones that are irrelevant to what action you want to perform. You can choose to either upload or download from the server.

4. Replace the `host`, `user`, and `password` with your own personal credentials and hit the save button.

5. Run the `index.py` script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 index.py
   ```

6. Upon execution, the script will give perform the commands required and you will notice changes on the FTP Server.

## Example

Here's a brief example of how to run the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elcruzo/ftp-client.git
cd ftp-client
python3 index.py
```
